Post/Page specific custom CSS will allow you to add cascade stylesheet to specific posts/pages. It will give you special area in the post/page edit field to attach your CSS. It will also let you decide if this CSS has to be added in multi-page/post view (like archive posts) or only in a single view.

Automatic installation is the easiest. Simply log in to your WordPress admin panel, go to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

1. That's all folks, have fun :)

== Requirements ==

This plugin requires WordPress <b>4.7</b> (never forget to update your WP installation!) and <b>PHP 5.3</b> installed on your server. It is pretty uncommon to offer previous versions of the PHP, however I must note that.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? =
Yes, it is under GPLv2 (and later) licence. However, you can donate me a few dollars if it makes you feel good. I certainly have nothing against it.

== Screenshots ==

1. If you can't see CSS panel, check screen options and make sure "Custom CSS" is checked
2. Write your CSS code available only for your post or page. You may force the plugin to add CSS code only on single page view.
